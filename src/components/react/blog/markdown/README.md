### `src/components/react/blog/markdown/`

These components map to the **AST** elements generated from blog markdown content.

Some components like `code_block` map to special element types. These are denoted with snake case. For example, `code_block` is a custom *TinaMarkdown*-generated component that maps to code blocks.
